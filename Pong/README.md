# 🏓Pong

My take on a classic using the Kivy Framework

__There are currently 3 versions of the app__

1) __Version 1:__ A 2 player touch screen game (in Ver1 folder)

2) __Version 2:__ A single player "against the wall" game (in Ver2 folder)

3) __Version 3:__ A single player "against the computer" game (in Ver3 folder)



## Version 1
